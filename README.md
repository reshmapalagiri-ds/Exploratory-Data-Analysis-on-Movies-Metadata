# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## 🎬 Movies Metadata Analysis Project

## 📖 Overview

The Movies Metadata Analysis Project is a data exploration and visualization project aimed at uncovering trends and insights in the movie industry.
Using a comprehensive dataset containing thousands of movies with attributes like genres, ratings, budgets, revenues, and release years, this project focuses on:

Cleaning raw metadata

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualizing trends and correlations

Drawing insights about what drives a movie’s success


This project demonstrates data wrangling, analytical thinking, and storytelling through data — all essential skills for a Data Analyst / Data Scientist role.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess movie metadata to ensure data quality

Analyze trends in movie production and popularity over the years

Visualize key patterns across genres, ratings, and revenues

Understand how factors like budget, genre, and release year influence performance

Present insights that help understand audience preferences and market behavior


## 🧩 Dataset Details

Number of Records: ~45,000 movies

Key Features:

title – Name of the movie

genres – List of genres associated with the movie

release_date – Year of release

budget – Production budget (USD)

revenue – Worldwide revenue (USD)

vote_average – Average audience rating

vote_count – Number of audience votes

popularity – Popularity score based on TMDB data


## 🧠 Tools & Technologies Used

Language: Python 🐍

Libraries:

Data Handling → pandas, numpy

Visualization → matplotlib, seaborn


## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Steps performed during preprocessing include:

Removing null or inconsistent values in key columns

Converting data types (e.g., dates and numeric values)

Extracting release year from release date

Splitting and simplifying genre lists for analysis

Handling outliers in budget and revenue

Removing duplicate records


## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analyses were performed:

1. Movies by Year: Trend in movie releases across decades


2. Top Genres: Most frequent and top-rated genres


3. Budget vs Revenue: Correlation and scatter plot


4. Top Performing Movies: Highest-rated and highest-grossing films


5. Average Ratings by Genre: Genre preferences over time


6. Popularity Distribution: Most popular movies based on TMDB popularity score


## 🔍 Key Insights

The number of movies released increased sharply after 2000

Drama, Action, and Comedy are the most common genres

Movies with higher budgets generally show higher revenues, but not always higher ratings

A few low-budget movies achieved great success due to strong storytelling

Certain years (e.g., 2010–2015) saw consistent high revenue trends across genres


## 📈 Visualizations

Some of the key visualizations include:

📆 Movie releases by year

🎭 Genre frequency distribution

💰 Budget vs Revenue scatter plot

⭐ Top 10 highest-rated movies

📊 Popularity vs Vote Count comparison
